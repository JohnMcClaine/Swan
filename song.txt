On a long and lonesome highway
East of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin'
Out this one-note song
You'd think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin'
The way they always do
When you're ridin' 16 hours
There's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin'
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go playin' the star again
There I go, turn the page
